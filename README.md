# Relaxed Adaptive Projection
Hello! This GitHub repository contains code originally from the paper [Differentially Private Query Release Through Adaptive Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06641).

This is an adaptation by Kamryn Ohly and Joanna Boyland of the original source code. 

You may run this code by using the following command to run our simple experiment:
python3 main.py -c simple_config.txt   

Otherwise, feel free to add and test the code on your own dataset. If you choose
to add your own code, be sure to add hints within the TRAIN function of rap.py.

You will also need to add a basic JSON file as your dataset's domain, and an example
(even empty) dataset to create the dimensions of your dataset. Then, you may create
a configuration file mimicking the simple_config.txt file already given.

Thank you!
